  						<p>The cute little babe pictured above is a two-toed sloth, of which there are two species belonging to the Megalonychidae family. The four species of three-toed sloths, on the other hand, are part of the Bradypodidae family. The two groups are only distant relatives and have a few notable differences between them. While three-toed sloths are active in the daytime, two-toed sloths are nocturnal creatures. Three-toed sloths are also smaller and slower than their two-toed counterparts.</p>

  						<p>The Tarantula Hawk Wasp is a common desert wasp of the Southwest, but it can be found anywhere the tarantula is found. As its name suggests, this wasp preys on tarantulas, in much the same way a hawk preys on rodents. Although the sting of this wasp is said to be the most painful of any insect found in North America, it is not aggressive and rarely stings. It is, in fact, much more dangerous to tarantulas—paralyzing them in order to feed them to their young—than to humans.</p>

  						<p class="description">The white Bengal tigers are distinctive due to the color of their fur. The white fur caused by a lack of the pigment pheomelanin, which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. When compared to Bengal tigers, the white Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and heavier than the orange Bengal tiger. They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown adults. White Bengal tigers are fully grown when they are 2–3 years of age. White male tigers reach weights of 200 to 230 kilograms (440 to 510 lb) and can grow up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) in length. As with all tigers, the white Bengal tiger’s stripes are like fingerprints, with no two tigers having the same pattern.</p>
